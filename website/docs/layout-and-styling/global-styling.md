Global Style refers to the overall design of the grid, which is controlled using CSS.

The grid's Global Style is highly customizable:

* The first step is to select a theme from one of our provided themes.
* Next you can apply customizations to the theme using CSS variables and rules.
* If you want to change the appearance of individual columns, headers or cells then consider using [row styles](./styling-rows) or [cell styles](./styling-cells)
