The BBjGridExWidget is a BBj Plug-in that was first included with BBj `18.21`. It is a feature-rich grid component for BBj based on HTML and JavaScript. Because it is HTML/Javascript based, it works and loads quickly in BUI programs. But it is not limited to BUI â€” it can also be used in GUI by combining it with the [BBjHtmlView](https://documentation.basis.cloud/BASISHelp/WebHelp/bbjobjects/Window/bbjhtmlview/bbjhtmlview.htm?Highlight=BBjHtmlView) control, leveraging the Chromium engine. 

The BBjGridExWidget is optimized to display large data sets based on the [basiscomponents](http://basishub.github.io/components/javadoc/com/basiscomponents/db/ResultSet.html). Just build a ResultSet and fill the grid.

Dashboards usually do not show large amounts of data, but the BBjGridExWidget brings other features that are also useful in a Dashboard. Starting as a preview in BBj `19.10`, BASIS made the BBjGridExWidget available in the [Dashboard](https://documentation.basis.cloud/BASISHelp/WebHelp/bbutil/Dashboard/Dashboard.htm) with the [GridExWidget](https://documentation.basis.cloud/BASISHelp/WebHelp/utils/Dashboard/GridExWidget.html) class.

:::caution
The BBjGridExWidget depends on [process_events](https://documentation.basis.cloud/BASISHelp/WebHelp/commands/process_events_verb.htm?Highlight=process_events) and will not work within programs that use [READ RECORD](https://documentation.basis.cloud/BASISHelp/WebHelp/commands/read_verb.htm) loops to handle events. As it internally relies on certain events being fired, programs also must be free from calls to [BBjSysGui::flushEvents](https://documentation.basis.cloud/BASISHelp/WebHelp/bbjobjects/SysGui/bbjsysgui/bbjsysgui_flushevents.htm?Highlight=flushEvents), especially in the phase between instantiating the BBjGridExWidget class and the first time the program execution reaches process_events.
